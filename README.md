# Go Together

A Tourism Recommender System Based on Social Network and Real-time Weather Information

## Abstract
Planning an itinerary is a cumbersome procedure. Tourism recommender systems pop up recommending users tourist attractions in their preference. We propose a system integrated with the social network, called GoTogether, aiming to provide users and their friends with the touring information according to the geometric and their common interests, but also combined with the real-time weather forecast. Due to the different types of information, efficient data storage and extraction is one of the challenges. On the other hand, the design of the cross-database recommendation procedure is another issue. As the following, we will focus on the database build-ups and system integration.
